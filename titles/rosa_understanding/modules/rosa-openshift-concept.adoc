OpenShift is a Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads. It extends the Kubernetes platform with built-in software to enhance app lifecycle development, operations, and security. With OpenShift, you can consistently deploy your workloads across hybrid cloud providers and environments.
