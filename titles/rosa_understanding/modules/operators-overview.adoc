= Operators in {product-title}

In {product-title}, Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying,
and managing services on the control plane. They also provide advantages to
applications that users run. Operators integrate with
Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc` commands. They provide
the means of watching over an application, performing health checks, managing
over-the-air updates, and ensuring that the applications remain in your
specified state.

Because CRI-O and the Kubelet run on every node, almost every other cluster
function can be managed on the control plane by using Operators. Operators are
among the most important components of {product-title} {product-version}.
Components that are added to the control plane by using Operators include
critical networking and credential services.

The Operator that manages the other Operators in an {product-title} cluster is
the Cluster Version Operator.

{product-title} {product-version} uses different classes of Operators to perform
cluster operations and run services on the cluster for your applications to use.


[id="OLM-operators_{context}"]
== Operators managed by OLM

The Cluster Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) component manages Operators
that are available for use in applications. It does not manage the Operators that
comprise {product-title}.
OLM is a framework that manages Kubernetes-native applications as Operators.
Instead of managing Kubernetes manifests, it manages Kubernetes Operators.
OLM manages two classes of Operators, Red Hat Operators and certified Operators.

Some Red Hat Operators drive the cluster functions, like the scheduler and
problem detectors. Others are provided for you to manage yourself and use in
your applications, like etcd. {product-title} also offers certified Operators,
which the community built and maintains. These certified Operators provide an
API layer to traditional applications so you can manage the application through
Kubernetes constructs.
