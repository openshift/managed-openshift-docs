== Cluster backup policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is critical that customers have a backup plan for their applications and application data.
====
Application and application data backups are not a part of the {product-title} service.
All Kubernetes objects and PVs in each {product-title} cluster are backed up to facilitate a prompt recovery in the unlikely event that a cluster becomes irreparably inoperable.

The backups are stored in a secure object storage (Multi Availability Zone) bucket in the same account as the cluster.
Node root volumes are not backed up as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS is fully managed by the OpenShift Container Platform cluster and no stateful data should be stored on a node's root volume.

The following table shows the frequency of backups:
[cols="4",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Snapshot Frequency
|Retention
|Notes

|Full object store backup, all cluster PVs
|Daily at 0100 UTC
|7 days
|This is a full backup of all kubernetes objects, as well as all mounted PVs in the cluster.

|Full object store backup, all cluster PVs
|Weekly on Mondays at 0200 UTC
|30 days
|This is a full backup of all kubernetes objects, as well as all mounted PVs in the cluster.

|Full object store backup
|Hourly at 17 minutes past the hour
|24 hours
|This is a full backup of all kubernetes objects. No PVs are backed up in this backup schedule.

== Autoscaling
Node autoscaling is not available on {product-title} at this time.

== Daemonsets
Customers may create and run DaemonSets on {product-title}. In order to restrict DaemonSets to only running on worker nodes, use the following nodeSelector:
----
...
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
...
----

== Multiple availability zone
In a multiple availability zone cluster, master nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least three worker nodes are required in each availability zone.

== Node labels
Custom node labels are created by Red Hat during node creation and cannot be changed on {product-title} clusters at this time.

== Openshift version
{product-title} is run as a service and is kept up-to-date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version.

== Upgrades
Patch level (also known as z-stream; x.y.Z) updates are applied automatically the week following their release as long as {product-title}-specific end-to-end tests pass.

Minor version updates (x.Y.z) may include Kubernetes version upgrades and/or API changes. Therefore, customers are notified by email two weeks in advance before these upgrades are automatically applied.

== Window containers
Window containers are not available on {product-title} at this time.

== Container engine
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O ] as the only available container engine.

== Operating system
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS as the operating system for all master and worker nodes.

== Kubernetes operator support
{product-title} supports non-privileged Operators created by Red Hat and Certified ISVs.
