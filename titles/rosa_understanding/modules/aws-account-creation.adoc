= Creating an AWS account with IAM permissions

[role="_abstract"]
Before you can configure access to the AWS infrastructure, you will need to set up IAM permissions in your AWS account.

.Procedure

. Log in to your AWS account. If necessary, you can create a new AWS account by following the link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/[AWS documentation].

. Create an IAM user with `STS:AllowAssumeRole` permissions within the AWS account.
.. Open the IAM dashboard of the AWS Management Console.
.. In the *Policies* section, click *Create Policy*.
.. Select the `JSON` tab and replace the existing text with the following:
+
----
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
  }
----
.. Click *Review Policy*.
.. Provide an appropriate name and description, then click *Create Policy*.
.. In the *Users* section, click *Add user*.
.. Provide an appropriate user name.
.. Select *AWS Management Console access* and other roles as needed.
.. Adjust the password requirements as necessary for your organization, then click *Next: Permissions*.
.. Click the *Attach existing policies directly* option.
.. Search for and check the policy created in previous steps.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not recommended to set a permissions boundary.
====
.. Click *Next: Tags*, you can optionally add IAM tags to your user.
.. Click *Next: Review*. Confirm the configuration is correct.
.. Click *Create user*, then click *Close* on the success page.
. Gather the IAM user's link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-cmk-id-arn.html[Amazon Resource Name (ARN)]. The ARN will have the following format: `arn:aws:iam::000111222333:user/username`.
