Once you have created an AWS account with the proper IAM permissions, you must grant the IAM role from *OpenShift Cluster Manger (OCM)*.

.Procedure

. Open the {product-title} Cluster Manager in your browser and select the cluster you want to allow AWS infrastructure access.

. Select the *Access control* tab, and scroll to the *AWS Infrastructure Access* section.

. Click *Grant role*.

. Paste the AWS IAM ARN and select `Network Management` or `Read-only` permissions in the pop-up window, then click *Grant role*.

. An *AWS OSD console URL* will generate, copy the URL to your clipboard when the status reads *Ready*.

. Sign in to your AWS account with your Account ID or alias, IAM user name, and password.

. In a new browser tab, paste the AWS OSD Console URL that will be used to route to the AWS Switch Role page.

. Your account number and role will be filled in already. Choose a display name if necessary, then click *Switch Role*. You will now see *IAM* under *Recently visited services*.
