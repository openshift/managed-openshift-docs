= Storage

== Encrypted-at-rest OS/Node storage
Master nodes use encrypted-at-rest-EBS storage.

== Encrypted-at-rest PV
EBS volumes used for persistent volumes are encrypted-at-rest by default.

== Block storage (RWO)
Persistent volumes are backed by block storage (AWS EBS and Google Cloud persistent disk), which is Read-Write-Once. On an {product-title} base cluster, 100GB of block storage is provided for persistent volumes, which is dynamically provisioned and recycled based on application requests. Additional persistent storage can be purchased in 500GB increments.

Persistent volumes can only be attached to a single node at a time and are specific to the availability zone in which they were provisioned, but they can be attached to any node in the availability zone.

Each cloud provider has its own limits for how many PVs can be attached to a single node. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html#instance-type-volume-limits[AWS instance type limits] or link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#custom_machine_types[Google Cloud Platform custom machine types ] for details.

== Shared storage (RWX)
Shared storage is not available on {product-title} at this time.
