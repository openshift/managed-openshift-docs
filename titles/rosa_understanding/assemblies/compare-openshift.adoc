= Comparing {product-title} to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} uses the same code base as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, but as a managed offering is installed by Red Hat to optimize performance, scalability, and security. {product-title} is managed by Red Hat and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription entitles you to host and manage the software on your own infrastructure.
