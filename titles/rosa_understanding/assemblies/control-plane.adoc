= Understanding the {product-title} control plane


[role="_abstract"]
The control plane, which is composed of master machines, manages the {product-title} cluster. The control plane machines manage workloads on the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. The cluster itself manages all upgrades to the machines by the actions of the Cluster Version Operator, the Machine Config Operator, and a set of individual Operators.
