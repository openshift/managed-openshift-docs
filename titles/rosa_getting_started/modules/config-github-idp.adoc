= Configuring a GitHub identity provider

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a GitHub identity provider to validate user names and passwords against GitHub or GitHub Enterpriseâ€™s OAuth authentication server and access your {product-title} cluster.OAuth facilitates a token exchange flow between {product-title} and GitHub or GitHub Enterprise.

[WARNING]
====
Configuring GitHub authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with their GitHub credentials. To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging in to your {product-title} cluster, you must restrict access to only those in specific GitHub organizations.
====

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Clusters* page and select the cluster you need to configure identity providers for.

. Click the *Access control* tab. Note: You can also click the *AddOauth configuration* link in the warning message displayed after cluster creation to configure your identity providers.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

. Select *GitHub* from the drop-down menu.

. Enter a unique name for the identity provider. This name cannot be changed later. An *OAuth callback URL* is automatically generated in the provided field. You will use this to register the GitHub application.

.  Register an application on GitHub:
- For GitHub, click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/apps[Developer settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[OAuth Apps] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application].
 - For GitHub Enterprise, go to your GitHub Enterprise home page and then click
*Settings -> Developer settings -> Register a new application*.
.. Enter an application name, for example `My OpenShift Install`.
.. Enter a homepage URL, such as
`\https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>`.
.. Optional: Enter an application description.
.. Enter the authorization callback URL.
+
----
https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>/oauth2callback/<idp-provider-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
https://oauth-openshift.apps.example-openshift-cluster.com/oauth2callback/github/
----
.. Click *Register application*. GitHub provides a Client ID and a Client Secret.
You need these values to complete the identity provider configuration.

. Return to {product-title} and select a mapping method from the drop-down menu. *Claim* is recommended in most cases.

. Enter the *Client ID* and *Client secret* provided by GitHub.

. You must enter a *hostname* to use with a hosted instance of GitHub Enterprise.

. Optional: You can use a certificate authority (CA) file to validate server certificates for the configured GitHub Enterprise URL. Click *Browse* to locate and attach a *CA file* to the identity provider.

. Select *Use organizations* or *Use teams* to restrict access to a particular GitHub organization or a GitHub team.

. Enter the name of the organization or team you would like to restrict access to. Click *Add more*
to specify multiple organizations or teams that users can be a member of.

. Click *Confirm*.

The configured identity provider is now visible on the
 *Access control* tab of the *Clusters* page.
