= Overview of responsibilities for {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
While Red Hat manages the {product-title} service, the customer shares responsibility with respect to certain aspects. The {product-title} services are accessed remotely, hosted on public cloud resources, created in either Red Hat or customer-owned cloud service provider accounts, and have underlying platform and data security that is owned by Red Hat.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `cluster-admin` role is enabled on a cluster, please see the responsibilities and exclusion notes in the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements[Red Hat Enterprise Agreement Appendix 4 (Online Subscription Services)].
