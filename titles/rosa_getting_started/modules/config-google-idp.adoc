Using Google as an identity provider allows any Google user to authenticate to your server.
You can limit authentication to members of a specific hosted domain with the
`hostedDomain` configuration attribute.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

. Select *Google* from the drop-down menu.

. Enter a unique name for the identity provider. This name cannot be changed later. An *OAuth callback URL* is automatically generated in the provided field. You will provide this URL to Google.

. Enter the *Client ID* of a registered Google project and the *Client secret* issued by Google.

. Enter a hosted domain to restrict users to a Google Apps domain.

The configured identity provider is now visible on the
 *Access control* tab of the *Clusters* page.
