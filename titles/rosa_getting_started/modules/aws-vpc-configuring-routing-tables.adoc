= Configuring the routing tables

[role="_abstract"]
After you accept the VPC peering request, the routes for both VPCs must be configured to communicate across the peering connection.

.Prerequisites

* Initiate and accept the VPC peer request.

.Procedure

. Log in to the AWS Web Console for the OSD AWS Account.

. Navigate to the *VPC Service*, then *Route Tables*.

. Select the Route Table for the {product-title} Cluster VPC.
+
[NOTE]
====
On some clusters, there may be more than one route table for a particular VPC. Select the private one that has a number of explicitly associated subnets.
====

. Select the *Routes* tab, then *Edit routes*.

. Enter the Customer VPC CIDR block for the *Destination*.

. Enter the Peering Connection ID for the *Target*.

. Click *Save routes*.

. You must complete the same process with the other VPC's CIDR block:
.. Log into the Customer AWS Web Console → *VPC Service* → *Route Tables*.
.. Select the Route Table for your VPC.
.. Select the *Routes* tab, then *Edit routes*.
.. Enter the {product-title} Cluster VPC CIDR block for the *Destination*
.. Enter the Peering Connection ID for the *Target*.
.. Click *Save routes*.

The VPC peering connection is now complete. Follow the verification procedure to
ensure connectivity across the peering connection is working.
