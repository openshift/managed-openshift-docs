Red Hat recommends the usage of Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts. The Organization, managed by the customer, hosts multiple AWS accounts. There is a root account in the organization that all accounts ultimately refer to in the account hierarchy.

It is a best practice for the {product-title} CCS cluster to be hosted in an AWS account within an AWS Organizational Unit. A SCP is created and applied to the Organizational Unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access. The SCP applies only to available permissions within a single AWS account for all sub-accounts within the Organizational Unit. You can also apply a SCP to a single account. All other accounts in the customerâ€™s Organization are managed in whatever manner the customer requires. Red Hat SRE will not have any control over SCPs within the AWS Organization.
