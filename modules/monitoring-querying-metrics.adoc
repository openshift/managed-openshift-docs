= Querying metrics

[role="_abstract"]
The OpenShift monitoring dashboard lets you run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a `dedicated-admin`, you can query one namespace at a time for metrics about user-defined projects.

As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.
