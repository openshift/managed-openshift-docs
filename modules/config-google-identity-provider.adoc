= Configuring a Google identity provider

Configure a Google identity provider to allow users to authenticate with their Google credentials.

.Prerequisite

Configure a Google identity provider using
link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google's OpenID Connect integration].

[NOTE]

[WARNING]
====
Using Google as an identity provider allows any Google user to authenticate to your server.
You can limit authentication to members of a specific hosted domain with the
`hostedDomain` configuration attribute.
====

.Procedure
To configure a Google identity provider for your {product-title} cluster:

. Navigate to the *Clusters* page and select the cluster you need to configure identity providers for.

. Click the *Access control* tab.
Note: You can also click the *AddOauth configuration* link in the warning message displayed after cluster creation to configure your identity providers.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

. Select *Google* from the drop-down menu.

. Enter a unique name for the identity provider. This name cannot be changed later. An *OAuth callback URL* is automatically generated in the provided field. You will provide this URL to Google.

. Select a mapping method from the drop-down menu. *Claim* is recommended in most cases.

. Enter the *Client ID* of a registered Google project and the *Client secret* issued by Google.

. Enter a hosted domain to restrict users to a Google Apps domain.

. Click *Confirm*.

The configured identity provider is now visible on the
 *Access control* tab of the *Clusters* page.
