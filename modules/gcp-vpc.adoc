= Configuring GCP VPC peering

[role="_abstract"]
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. You can configure a {GCP} VPC containing an {product-title} cluster to peer with another GPC VPC network.

[WARNING]
====
Private clusters cannot be fully deleted by the {cloud-redhat-com} if the VPC the cluster is installed in is peered.
====

.Prerequisites

* Gather the following information about the Customer VPC that is required to initiate the peering request:
** GCP project ID that contains the VPC you want to peer.
** Customer VPC ID
** A subnet CIDR range in one peered VPC network cannot overlap with a static route in another peered network. This rule covers both subnet routes and static routes. See the link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering#restrictions[restrictions] in the GCP documentation for more information.
