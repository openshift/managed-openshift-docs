= Configuring GCP Cloud Interconnect

[role="_abstract"]
{GCP} Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, high availability connections that enable you to reliably transfer data between your on-premises and Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. Also, Interconnect connections provide internal IP address communication, which means internal IP addresses are directly accessible from both networks.

Cloud Interconnect offers two options for extending your on-premises network:

* *Dedicated Interconnect*: Provides a direct physical connection between your on-premises network and Google's network.
* *Partner Interconnect*: Provides connectivity between your on-premises and VPC networks through a supported service provider.
