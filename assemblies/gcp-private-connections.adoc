If your {product-title} cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you must configure private connections in your {GCP} account to access the cluster.

You can use one or more of the following methods to establish a private connection to your cluster:

* xref:../modules/gcp-vpc.adoc#gcp-vpc[Configuring GCP VPC peering]: Enable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering to route network traffic between two private IP addresses.

* xref:../modules/gcp-vpn.adoc#gcp-vpn[Configuring GCP Cloud VPN]: Establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to securely connect your private network to your GCP VPC.

* xref:../modules/gcp-direct-connect.adoc#gcp-direct-connect[Configuring GCP Cloud Interconnect]: Provides low latency, high availability connections that enable you to reliably transfer data between your on-premises and Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks.
