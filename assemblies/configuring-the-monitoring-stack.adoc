[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} 4 installation program provides only a low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most {product-title} framework components, including the cluster monitoring stack, happens post-installation.

This section explains what configuration is supported, shows how to configure the monitoring stack, and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

== Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.html[Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

// Configuring persistent storage
[id="configuring-persistent-storage"]
== Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume (PV) and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

[IMPORTANT]

=== Persistent storage prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods. For information on system requirements for persistent storage, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#prometheus-database-storage-requirements[Prometheus database storage requirements].

* Make sure you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the persistent volume claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Because Prometheus has two replicas and Alertmanager has three replicas, you need five PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The PVs should be available from the Local Storage Operator. This does not apply if you enable dynamically provisioned storage.

* Use the block type of storage.
