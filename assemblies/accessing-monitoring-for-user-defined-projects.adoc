[role="_abstract"]
By default, centralized monitoring for user-defined projects and platform monitoring are enabled. You can monitor your own projects in {product-title} without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

Monitoring user-defined projects cannot be disabled.

The `dedicated-admin` user has default permissions to configure and access monitoring for user-defined projects.

[NOTE]
====
Custom Prometheus instances and the Prometheus Operator installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can cause issues with user-defined workload monitoring if it is enabled. Custom Prometheus instances are not supported.
